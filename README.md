## This is my first React Project.     

React applications are SPA, there is only one index html file.   
Here, the routing process was performed by changing the components.   
Working with real data is provided by creating db.json with React API.   
By using the map function, the elements of the list are returned one by one.   
Data transfer from one component to another was done with Props.   
ReactStrap library and alertifyjs implementation are used.  
Used the react-router-dom library.
